# Fraud Detection in financial transactions

Financial institutions face the challenge of detecting fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently. The primary objectives are to identify and flag potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time. Additionally, we want to minimize our financial losses due to fraud while maintaining a high level of customer trust. With this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can effectively tackle these challenges, providing a fraud detection system to protect both the institution and customers.
